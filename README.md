This repository contains data and code (SPARQL queries and scripting) to extract the published formalization papers (in the form of nanopublications) from the nanopublication decentralized network. It also contains the scripts made for the automatic visualization of these nanopublications in the form of a graph and a script to create the index for these nanopublications.

These formalization papers will be published in the IOS Press journal Data Science, in a special issue with formalization papers in late March 2022.
